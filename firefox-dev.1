.TH "FIREFOX DEVELOPER EDITION" 1 "May 6, 2016" firefox-dev "Linux User's Manual"

.SH NAME
Firefox Developer Edition (aka Firefox Aurora) is the pre-beta release of
Mozilla's Web browser



.SH SYNOPSIS
.B firefox-dev
[\fIOPTIONS\fR] [\fIURL\fR]



.SH DESCRIPTION
This is a pre-beta release of Mozilla Firefox, intended for Web developers and
enthusiasts who want early access to new features. It receives new updates
(almost) daily, adding and refining support for the very latest Web standards
that won't make it into the stable release of Firefox for some months. It also
comes with some addons enabled by default, providing extra tools for Web
developers.

You may actually find that Firefox Developer Edition works just fine for normal
everyday use: Some users set it as their default Web browser. You can sign in to
your normal Firefox account and sync your preferences, extensions, and
bookmarks, etc. Or you can keep the Firefox versions separate, and use different
profiles, even different browser UI themes. Firefox Developer Edition can
install alongside the stable release of Firefox, making it easy to switch back
and forth between the two versions.

That being said, a lot of the technology here is still experimental, and there
will very likely be some bugs, so just remember that by using Developer Edition,
you're helping Mozilla make Firefox the best Web browser they can. And have fun!

Bugs related to Firefox Developer Edition should be reported directly to Mozilla -
